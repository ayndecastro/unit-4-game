Battle of the Presidents.
this game features 4 of the most meadia featured current presidents.
the game is supposed to be funny and in no means am I purposely disrespecting
any presidents in the game. 

Mechanics:
1. player will choose a character from the choose your leader column.
2. the first character selected will be the 'supreme leader' (or your character if you're uncomfortable with the term).
3. the remaining characters in the 'choose your leader row' will be the 'supreme destroyer' (or the enemy, again, if you're uncomfortable
  with the term)
4. the player will defeate the enemy one-by-one.
5. the fight sequence is initiated by the 'nuke' button (or attack button, again if your uncomfortable with the term)
6. everytime you initiate the fight sequence, your character's attack points will increase by the base attack points. the enemy's attack
  points will stay the same.
5. if the player wins, the page will load a congratiolations.html page. if you lose.... well, it's game-over.

**warning**
**THE GAME-OVER PAGE IS MEANT TO SPOOK YOU.**

enjoy the game!
and save the world from Nukes. by attack with ......Nukes of your own.
yes it's bad. deal with it!



MAKE AMERICA... why are you even reading this? just play the game. geez!
